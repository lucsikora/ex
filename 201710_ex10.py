# This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require the
# solution in a different way.
#
# Take two lists, say for example these two:
#
# 	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# 	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
#
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between
# the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
# Write this in one line of Python using at least one list comprehension. (Hint: Remember list comprehensions
# from Exercise 7).
#
# The original formulation of this exercise said to write the solution using one line of Python,
# but a few readers pointed out that this was impossible to do without using sets that
# I had not yet discussed on the blog, so you can either choose to use the original directive and
# read about the set command in Python 3.3, or try to implement this on your own and use at least one
# list comprehension in the solution.
#
# Extra:
#
#     Randomly generate two lists to test this

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
c = []
# c = [i for i in a for y in b if i == y ]
c = [x for x in set([a if len(a)>len(b) else b][0]) if (x in set(a)) and (x in set(b))]

print(c)


# Extra 1
import random
a, b = random.sample(range(100),10), random.sample(range(100),10)
c = [x for x in set([a if len(a)>len(b) else b][0]) if (x in set(a)) and (x in set(b))]
print("Extra task: ", c)
